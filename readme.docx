This page was built using html, css, and javascript. It will use local storage to remember your results of each survey.
An object model of the surveys will be built by instantiating new survey object per question leaving ease to add new survey questions

The parts of the survey will be the background panel, header, input, validation, forward arrow and back arrow (to scroll through the questions).

Classes will be added during creation and deconstruction of the questions to allow for new questions and css to be added to be built in place.

Created fake data to pass through functions and ensure their logic was correct in my intial hypothesis.
